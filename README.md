# trading-ml

ML + trading research lab on NautilusTrader using free Alpaca daily-bar data.
Long-running project — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-trading-ml-design.md`
for the full design, philosophy, and staged roadmap.

## Status

- [x] Stage 0 — Project skeleton + Nautilus smoke backtest
- [x] Stage 1 — Alpaca → Nautilus ParquetDataCatalog ingestion pipeline
  - [x] Data pipeline built and unit-tested (universe, instruments, bar converter,
        Alpaca client, idempotent + overlap-safe ingest orchestrator)
  - [x] Live catalog populated (12 tickers; SPY ~2018-11, sector ETFs ~2020-07 → today on free-tier IEX).
        Cross-check passes at 1.5% tolerance (free-tier IEX vs yfinance SIP venue
        noise — see design spec §7).
- [x] Stage 2 — Momentum top-N strategy + tearsheet
  - [x] Pure ranker + Nautilus Strategy (monthly top-3 by 6m-skip-1 momentum) + quantstats tearsheet
  - [x] Acceptance backtest: `uv run python examples/backtest_momentum.py`
  - On the ~2020-07→2026 window the simple momentum strategy underperformed SPY buy-and-hold (≈9% vs ≈21% CAGR) — the expected honest baseline per the design spec; the milestone is a credible, reproducible tearsheet, not beating SPY.
- [x] Stage 3 — Honesty harness (walk-forward × param grid + Deflated Sharpe + cost stress)
  - [x] `analysis/{runspec,deflated_sharpe,metrics,runner,walk_forward,costs,harness_report}.py`
  - [x] Runnable: `uv run python examples/run_harness.py` (full) or `--smoke` (dev iteration)
  - [x] Acceptance run: 90 walk-forward + 4 cost-stress backtests over the full catalog. Winner: `top_n=3, lookback_days=63, skip_days=0` (3-month momentum without skip — different from Stage 2's hardcoded baseline). Winner median window Sharpe 1.02 (range [0.88, 1.68]); cluster of similarly-good configs (5-95th percentile of all combo-window Sharpes: [0.41, 1.66]); CAGR ≈16% across slippage 0→2 bps (robust to costs); Deflated Sharpe p=1.00, z=23.33 with n_trials=90 — the winner's Sharpe is unlikely to be pure selection bias.
  - The harness winner still underperforms SPY in CAGR (≈16% vs ≈21%) but has comparable risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ≈1.03 vs SPY ≈1.10) and a better max drawdown (-18% vs -25%). Honest characterization, not a deployment signal.
- [~] Stage 4 — LiveNode sim-live infrastructure
  - [x] `livesim/{data_client,exec_client,factories,node_config}.py` — `TradingNode` wiring with `CatalogLiveDataClient` (catalog-replay) + `SimulatedLiveExecutionClient` (next-bar fills, SELL-before-BUY buffering for cash-account safety).
  - [x] Runnable: `uv run python examples/run_trading_node.py --fast-replay` (one-shot) or `--poll-seconds N` (continuous).
  - [x] **Integration parity (synthetic, top_n=1)**: 0.38% drift vs `BacktestEngine` — well under the 1% gate. Runtime infrastructure validated end-to-end (tests/test_live_sim_integration.py).
  - [ ] **Real-catalog parity (top_n=3): KNOWN GAP.** Full 17k-bar catalog fast-replay produces final equity ≈$170k vs Stage-3 backtest's ≈$239k at the same slippage=0 — about 29% drift. Likely cause: async event ordering with cross-ticker rotations at top_n>1, which the synthetic test (top_n=1) doesn't surface. The TradingNode loop runs cleanly; the strategy makes credible trades; but parity with `BacktestEngine` on real data is not yet established. Stage-4.5 follow-up.
- [ ] Stages 5–8 — see design spec

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (Python 3.12)
uv sync

# 2. Get free Alpaca paper-account API keys at https://alpaca.markets/
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env and fill in ALPACA_API_KEY / ALPACA_API_SECRET

# 3. Smoke-test the engine (no data/credentials needed)
uv run python examples/smoke.py

# 4. Populate the data catalog (needs credentials; 1–5 min first run, seconds on re-runs).
#    Free-tier Alpaca uses DataFeed.IEX (~5.5 years of history, ~2020+ in practice).
#    SIP feed (2016+) requires a paid Alpaca Algo Trader Plus subscription.
uv run python data/ingest_alpaca.py

# 5. Validate the catalog against an independent source
uv run python scripts/cross_check_yfinance.py --ticker SPY
```

## Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (no network, no credentials)
uv run pytest tests -v --ignore=tests/test_catalog_integration.py

# Integration tests (real Alpaca calls — needs .env populated; auto-skip otherwise)
uv run pytest tests/test_catalog_integration.py -v
```

## Backtest

```bash
# Stage 2: momentum top-N over the full catalog → quantstats tearsheet
uv run python examples/backtest_momentum.py
```

Writes `equity.csv`, `spy_close.csv`, and `tearsheet.html` to `results/momentum_topn_<timestamp>/`.
Prints a CAGR / Sharpe / max-drawdown summary for the strategy vs SPY.

### Honesty harness

```bash
# Stage 3: walk-forward × parameter grid + Deflated Sharpe + cost stress
uv run python examples/run_harness.py            # full battery (90 + 4 backtests, ~1 min with Nautilus caching)
uv run python examples/run_harness.py --smoke    # tiny grid (~5 sec) for dev iteration
```

Writes `walk_forward.csv`, `cost_stress.csv`, `summary.json`, `summary.md` to `results/harness_<timestamp>/`.
Prints the 5-section Markdown verdict (time stability / parameter robustness / cost survival / Deflated Sharpe / bottom line).

### LiveNode sim-live

```bash
# Stage 4: TradingNode replay/continuous against the Stage-1 catalog
uv run python examples/run_trading_node.py --fast-replay --slippage-prob 0.0  # one-shot replay
uv run python examples/run_trading_node.py --poll-seconds 60                  # continuous, poll every 60s for dev
uv run python examples/run_trading_node.py                                    # continuous, poll daily (production cadence)
```

Wires `MomentumTopNStrategy` into Nautilus's `TradingNode` runtime via livesim's `CatalogLiveDataClient` + `SimulatedLiveExecutionClient`. Prints final equity. Strategy code is unchanged from Stage 2 (research→live parity).

⚠️ **Known gap (Stage 4.5):** real-catalog fast-replay differs from `BacktestEngine` by ~29% at the same slippage. The synthetic integration test (top_n=1) achieves 0.38% drift; the real catalog with top_n=3 surfaces an async event-ordering issue around cross-ticker rotation days that is not yet fully resolved.
